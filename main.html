	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is undertood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task.As a programmer ,your goal should reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b>is a related to amount of memory occuied by the program.For Example ,if a program take an array of size n as input,the space complexity of a program becomes O(n) </p>
