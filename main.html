	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It is used to determine how efficient an algorithm scales with increased input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity </b> refers to the total space or memory taken by an algorithm with respect to the input size. For example, if we input an array of size 'n', then it takes O(n) space in memory.</p>
